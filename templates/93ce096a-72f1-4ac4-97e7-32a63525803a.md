In this article, I will share my experiences as an Aspie programmer, explore the complexities of Asperger’s syndrome, delve deeper into the pros and cons of having Aspies on programming teams, and offer practical tips for neurotypical colleagues to foster a collaborative and inclusive work environment.

# **Understanding Asperger’s Syndrome**

Asperger’s syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder on the autism spectrum, characterized by differences in social communication, behavior, and sensory processing.

Individuals with Asperger’s often possess above-average intelligence, yet they may struggle with social cues, nonverbal communication, and emotional expression.

- **Social communication**: Aspies may have difficulty interpreting social cues, such as facial expressions, tone of voice, or body language. They might struggle with understanding humor, sarcasm, or idiomatic expressions, which can lead to misunderstandings in conversations and social interactions.

- **Restricted and repetitive behaviors**: Individuals with Asperger’s may exhibit repetitive behaviors or develop intense, focused interests in specific topics. These interests can become a source of expertise and passion, but they may also make it difficult for Aspies to engage in more varied activities or conversations.

- **Sensory sensitivities**: Aspies may be particularly sensitive to sensory stimuli, such as bright lights, loud noises, or certain textures. This heightened sensitivity can make everyday environments, like busy offices or crowded spaces, overwhelming and uncomfortable.

- **Executive functioning**: Some individuals with Asperger’s may experience challenges with executive functioning, which includes skills like organization, planning, and time management. These difficulties can impact their ability to multitask or adapt to changes in routine or expectations.

As I navigated my professional life, I realized that my unique cognitive abilities and perspectives could be both a source of great strength and innovation, as well as a challenge in team settings.

# **Integrating Wellness Practices**

During my journey, I discovered the benefits of incorporating wellness practices into my daily life, such as meditation, yoga, long walks, and playing musical instruments.

I found that engaging in these activities for almost four years had a profound impact on my well-being, helping me better manage the challenges associated with Asperger’s syndrome.

- **Meditation**: Practicing meditation helped me develop mindfulness and increased self-awareness, which in turn improved my ability to recognize and manage emotions, as well as cope with stress and anxiety.

- **Yoga**: Yoga offered a combination of physical exercise, deep breathing, and mindfulness that helped me increase my body awareness, emotional regulation, and overall sense of well-being.

- **Long walks**: Taking long walks provided an opportunity for me to engage in light physical activity, clear my mind, and immerse myself in nature, which proved to be a great stress reliever.

- **Playing musical instruments**: Learning and playing musical instruments allowed me to channel my creativity, focus, and passion into a productive and enjoyable outlet. This also provided a way for me to connect with others through a shared interest in music.

# **The Crucial Role of Aspies in the Tech Industry**

Our world needs aspies. In fact, without them, it is doubtful whether places like Silicon Valley would even exist. As Temple Grandin, a renowned author and autism advocate, once said, “The world needs all kinds of minds.”

Aspies bring unique perspectives and skills to the table, often driving innovation and technological advancements.

As Steve Silberman, the author of “NeuroTribes: The Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity,” states, “In a world that’s become dependent on finely engineered technological systems, the ability to focus on a problem for a long time and to grasp its subtle details can be a major competitive advantage.”

# **The Pros and Cons of Aspies in Programming Teams**

## **The Pros:**

- **Exceptional focus and attention to detail**: One strength I found in myself as an Aspie programmer was my ability to concentrate intensely on tasks and notice even the smallest details. This skill proved invaluable for tasks that required precision, accuracy, and thoroughness in programming, such as code reviews and debugging.

- **Strong analytical and problem-solving skills**: My logical and abstract thinking abilities allowed me to approach problems from various angles and find innovative solutions. This proved to be a valuable asset in the fast-paced, constantly evolving world of technology.

- **Deep expertise in areas of interest**: I discovered that my passion for programming drove me to develop a deep understanding and expertise in my chosen field. This commitment to my interest helped me stay up-to-date with the latest developments and trends in the industry.

- **Unique perspectives**: As a neurodiverse individual, I realized that my different way of thinking could foster creativity, innovation, and breakthroughs in problem-solving. By including aspies like myself on a team, companies can tap into this potential for novel ideas and approaches.

## **The Cons:**

- **Social challenges**: One challenge I faced was difficulty in social situations, including understanding nonverbal cues, empathizing with others, and engaging in small talk. This made team collaboration and communication more challenging and sometimes led to misunderstandings or conflicts.

- **Sensitivity to stimuli**: I often found myself sensitive to external stimuli, such as noise, light, or temperature. Open office environments or shared workspaces could be particularly challenging, causing distraction or discomfort.

- **Need for routine and structure**: I thrived in environments with predictable routines and clear expectations. Adapting to sudden changes in project plans, team dynamics, or management styles was difficult and created additional stress or anxiety.

- **Difficulty with multitasking**: While I could be exceptionally focused on single tasks, I struggled with juggling multiple projects or priorities at once. This made it challenging for me to keep up with fast-paced, deadline-driven work environments.

# **Tips for Neurotypical People**

- **Practice patience and understanding**: I found it helpful when my colleagues recognized that I might communicate and process information differently and were patient and understanding in their interactions with me.

- **Provide clear instructions and expectations**: As an Aspie, I preferred explicit and precise instructions. Clear communication of expectations, deadlines, and objectives helped me succeed.

- **Establish routines and structure**: A predictable work environment with established routines and advance notice of any changes allowed me to feel more comfortable and better able to focus on my tasks.

- **Encourage open communication**: Fostering a culture of open communication within the team ensured that everyone’s needs, concerns, and ideas were heard and addressed. This helped to build trust and create a more inclusive and supportive work environment.

- **Provide accommodations**: I appreciated it when my colleagues and managers worked with me to determine what accommodations I might need to perform my best, such as a quieter workspace, noise-canceling headphones, or flexibility in scheduling.

- **Offer training and education**: Educating both spies and their neurotypical colleagues about Asperger’s syndrome and neurodiversity can help bridge communication gaps and foster a more inclusive environment.

- **Leverage their strengths**: Recognizing the unique strengths that Aspies bring to the team and finding ways to leverage those strengths in project assignments and team roles can help Aspies feel valued and more engaged in their work, while also benefiting the team as a whole.

- **Encourage team-building activities**: Facilitating team-building activities that cater to various communication styles and preferences made it easier for me to participate and build connections with my colleagues. This helped create a more cohesive and supportive team environment.
